AI can accelerate your workflow, inspire new solutions, and help you prototype faster than ever.
But there’s a hard truth that’s easy to forget: the code you get from AI isn’t the final code—and it shouldn’t be. It’s a draft. A sketch. A starting point. The real work begins when you refine it!

* The Code You Get Isn’t the Final Code
Most AI-generated code works, but it’s rarely production-ready. Ofen the code is messy, inconsistent, and built for the prompt. Even with Agent.md files the code is not ready for your project.

** Rough Around the Edges
AI code is usually filled with remnants from the iterative process—old snippets, unused variables, and duplicate logic. After a few rounds of prompting fragments from earlier prompts still exist that no longer serve a purpose.

Always reduce and test.

Take the time to remove the remnants, simplify where possible, and confirm the behavior through tests.
It’s your responsibility to make sure the code works as intended, not just looks correct. You also need to make sure that the code remains secure.

** Misaligned with Project Style
AI doesn’t know your project’s internal standards or preferences. An Agents.md file helps guide the AI to match the projects standards, but it will still make mistakes. It may hardcode values that should reference existing constants, skip your preferred helper functions, or use naming conventions that don’t fit your project.

It is your job to clean it up. Bring the code in line with your project’s idioms, structure, and tone.
AI gets you to “working,” but you still need to make it consistent and idiomatic to your project.

** Missing Elegance
AI-generated solutions are functional, but not necessarily elegant. They often default to verbose or procedural approaches rather than the idiomatic.

Examples include:
- Using `for` loops in Ruby instead of `10.times do`.
- Using `any` in TypeScript instead of proper typing.
- Repeating logic instead of abstracting into methods or components.

Elegance matters. It makes the code readable, maintainable, and easier for others to build on. One coherent style can go a long way as projects grow and mature.

* You Are the Artist, Not the Order-Taker
Treat AI’s output as a base. You’re not there to copy and paste, but to craft and complete.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
AI can scaffold your ideas, but your craftsmanship gives them structure.
#+END_QUOTE

You provide the taste, the discipline, and the final sense of quality.
Your judgment decides what stays, what changes, and what gets rewritten entirely.

* Practical Workflow
1. Let the AI generate the initial code.
2. Read it critically—look for assumptions, duplication, and unnecessary complexity.
3. Reduce and test. Verify that it behaves as expected.
4. Refactor to fit your project’s standards and style.
5. Replace generic logic with expressive, project-specific code.
6. Commit the final version when it’s clean, elegant, and maintainable.

* Closing Thoughts
AI can make you faster, but it doesn’t replace your taste, experience, or standards.
The real change isn’t in what the AI produces—it’s in how you respond to it.

The code it gives you is the base.
You are the artist completing the work.
