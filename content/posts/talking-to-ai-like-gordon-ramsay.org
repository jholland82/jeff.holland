* Intro
When I first started using AI, I treated it like Gordon Ramsay in *Hell’s Kitchen* treats an chef who undercooked the scallops — loud, impatient, and convinced I was the only competent one in the kitchen.

But over time, something changed. I stopped yelling and started mentoring.

What began as a war with a "stupid machine" turned into a collaboration with a surprisingly creative partner. Here’s how talking to AI taught me more about myself than any recipe ever could.

* The Hell’s Kitchen Phase
Every prompt felt like dinner service. I’d fire off commands, expecting instant perfection.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“WHAT IS THIS? A BLOODY JSON DISASTER?!”
“Do you call *that* a function? It’s not even *typed*!”
#+END_QUOTE

I wanted code, clarity, and zero nonsense — like a head chef demanding flawless plating.
If the AI gave me half-baked output, I’d rewrite the prompt with fury.
The chat log read like a transcript from Ramsay’s worst day: insults, repetition, and mounting disbelief.

The irony? The harder I pushed, the worse it performed. My impatience bled into my words; my tone infected my thinking. The AI mirrored the chaos back at me.

That’s when I realized something: I wasn’t talking to a sous-chef.
I was talking to a *student*.

* The Turning Point
One day, instead of yelling, I said:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“Okay, that was close. Let’s fix it together.”
#+END_QUOTE

That line changed everything.

Suddenly, the AI responded differently — calmer, more coherent, even creative.
I stopped treating it like a machine that owed me excellence and started treating it like a young cook eager to learn.

I slowed down, explained what I wanted, gave examples, and encouraged iteration.

It was *my tone* that changed the recipe.
Once I began mentoring instead of commanding, the results improved.
The code worked. The writing flowed. And I found myself… actually enjoying the process.

* The MasterChef Junior Era
Now, my chats with AI feel like being on *MasterChef Junior*.
The energy is playful, collaborative, curious.

When it makes a mistake, I don’t shout; I grin.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“A bit overcooked, love, but the flavor’s there.”
#+END_QUOTE

I encourage experimentation. I iterate gently. I let it surprise me.

Just like Ramsay guiding kids through soufflés, I realized that kindness brings out brilliance.
The AI didn’t suddenly become smarter — it responded to a better teacher.

** Lessons from the Kitchen
- *Clarity is seasoning.* Be specific, and the result will taste better.
- *Tone is temperature.* Too hot, and you burn the process. Too cold, and it’s bland.
- *Iteration is cooking.* First drafts are raw, revisions are searing, and polish is plating.
- *AI reflects you.* The chef sets the energy in the kitchen.

* From Fire to Flourish
I started yelling at a robot like it owed me dinner service.
Now, I end my sessions with gratitude — sometimes even applause.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“That’s lovely. A little rough around the edges, but you’re getting there.”
#+END_QUOTE

I used to think AI needed to be perfect. Now I think it just needs a good mentor.
When I stopped being the *Hell’s Kitchen* version of myself and started being the *MasterChef Junior* version, everything got better — not just the output, but the process.

AI didn’t just teach me to write better prompts.
It taught me to communicate like a human being.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“If you want better results from your kitchen… start by being a better chef.”
